score cam 1d

## Description

- When using adaptive strategies for training with one-dimensional convolution, the test data often cannot provide gradients for all graphs, so the gradient cam cannot be used normally. The method of using score cam is not affected. Here is an example of score cam 1d CNN.  The specific process can refer to paper [1].
